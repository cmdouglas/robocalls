        <p>One year ago, Donald Trump defended white supremacists who had killed a peaceful protester by calling them
            “very fine people.” Congress has not held him accountable.</p>

        <p>Play a recording of Trump’s statement for your Members of Congress to demand his administration be removed
            from office.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faqColumn">

            <p class="faqQuestion">Is this real? Will my Member of Congress listen?</p>
            <p class="faqAnswer">Yes and yes. This is a completely serious service for anyone who wants to contact their
                elected officials. Their staff will pick up the phone and listen to your message, which will include
                your name and the fact that you are a constituent.</p>

            <p class="faqQuestion">What am I asking Congress to do?</p>
            <p class="faqAnswer">Remove Donald Trump from office through impeachment. He is separating families and
                abusing children, discriminating against our people for their religion, encouraging white supremacists,
                obstructing justice and working with a foreign dictator to undermine our democracy. Impeachment will
                protect us from this president and make it possible to build a country that finally works for all of
                us.</p>


            <p class="faqQuestion">Why shouldn’t I just call Congress myself?</p>
            <p class="faqAnswer">You can! There is nothing wrong with a regular call, but Trump’s confession of sexual
                assault speaks for itself, and we thought this was more efficient.</p>

            <p class="faqQuestion">What does the recording say?</p>
            <iframe style="max-width:90%;" width="428" height="240" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2CGIijpzvaM"

            <p class="faqAnswer">“Hello [Representative’s Name]. Your constituent [Your name] from zip code [your zip
                code] thinks the following recording justifies the impeachment of Donald Trump: [recording plays]. Their
                number is [your number].” That’s all.</p>

            <p class="faqQuestion">Does it cost anything?</p>
            <p class="faqAnswer">This page is free to use, but every call costs the creators of this site,
                <a href="https://www.bytheppl.us" target="_blank">By The People</a>, a small amount. If you want to
